# CaveRunner

Cave Runner is a simple 2D infinite runner created with Unity.
Its still under construction, needs a lot of optimization and documentation. Currently the only are made by me are the background tiles and the different plattforms. 
Something i would like to change in the future since this is a personal project and i want it to be fully selfmade. 

# Running the game

If you want to try it just run the web version under /Builds/Web/Web.html   
Or run the CaveRunner.exe in /Builds/PC/CaveRunner.exe
Or just import the project in Unity. 

# Credtis

Although all art except the miner are licensed under CC0 i still want to give the artists credits.
