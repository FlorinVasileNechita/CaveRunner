# CaveRunner

Cave Runner is a simple 2D infinite runner created with Unity.
Its still under construction, needs a lot of optimization and documentation. Currently the only are made by me are the background tiles and the different plattforms. 
Something i would like to change in the future since this is a personal project and i want it to be fully selfmade.
